## this config is retired

I'm no longer running Vault inside of K8s only because I decided to
stand up a Consul cluster on the K8s master nodes. At that point, it
made more sense to have Vault running on those systems as well.

While I was using it, this Vault configuration worked well for me. I'm
leaving it here in case anyone else finds it useful, or in case I decide
to revisit it sometime in the future.
